# Blue Ripple Data Index

## Description
The table below contains links to all the data we use in our research pieces at [Blue Ripple Politics](https://www.blueripple.org).

- Some data we use exactly as is from a provider.  In that case we link our local copy in column 1 of the table and the provider page in column 2.
- Other data we pull using an API.  In that case we link our local version in column 1 and to an API reference or data source description in column 2.
- Finally, some data is too large to store a local copy on github.  In that case, we don't link to the outside data-set in column 1 and the provider in column 2.
